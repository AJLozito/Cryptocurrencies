# Cryptocurrencies

     The purpose of this project was to assess the cryptocurrency market and generate a report that includes the types of cryptocurrencies being traded and develop a classification system to group them as potential product offerings.


## Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
     In this step, I narrowed down the cryptocurrencies based on a variety of filters. The cryptocurrencies with these characteristics were eliminated:
1.)	Nontraded
2.)	Nonworking algorithms
3.)	Null values
4.)	Nonmined

## Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
     In this step, I used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to pare the data down to the three best possible principal components that could be used to evaluate the cryptocurrencies.

## Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
     In this step, I used my knowledge of the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve to find the best value for K in the PCA data frame created in Deliverable 2.

I also ran the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

## Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
     In this step, I used Plotly Express and hvplot to implement scatter plots to visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components that I created in Deliverable 2.

I also created a table of tradable currencies.
